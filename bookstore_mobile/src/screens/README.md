# Screens

This directory contains the main screens of the bookstore application. Each screen represents a distinct view or page that users can navigate to.

## Purpose
- Organizes the application's UI into logical, navigable views
- Composes components to create complete user interfaces
- Handles screen-specific logic and state
- Connects to the navigation system

## Structure
- `auth/` - Authentication-related screens (login, register, password reset)
- `home/` - Home screen and related views
- `browse/` - Book browsing and category screens
- `book/` - Individual book detail screens
- `cart/` - Shopping cart and checkout screens
- `profile/` - User profile and account management screens
- `orders/` - Order history and tracking screens
- `search/` - Search results and search interface screens
- `wishlist/` - User's wishlist screens

Each screen should focus on composition of components and screen-specific logic, while delegating reusable UI elements to the components directory.
